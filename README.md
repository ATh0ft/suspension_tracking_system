# suspension_tracking_system
A mountain bike suspension tracking project using the ESP32 and the AS5600 magnetic encoder (unfinished).

This project aims to create an affordable suspension tracking system that can be mounted on a mountain bike. To achieve this, the ESP32 is being programmed using the ![ESP-IDF](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf). The main sensors used are two AS5600 magnetic encoders to track the fork travel. The ESP32 logs the data to be analyzed on a PC.
